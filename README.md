iOS6-Calculator.app
===================

Clone of the iOS6 calculator app for the web

I started this project to learn CSS and Javascript. Currently this app does not have the full functionality of the iOS6 calculator app.

Update: Looks like somebody beat me to completion. Amazing project by [@mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson): ["I re-built the classic iOS Calculator in React"](https://codepen.io/mjijackson/pen/xOzyGX)

What it can and cannot do
--
* Status bar shows time the page was loaded and does not change
* Battery is randomly set between 20% and 99% (If below 20%, the icon would have to be red, and above 99%, the text would be three digits)
* Signal strength is static
* Mouse over any button for it to appear pressed
* Only number buttons appear on the screen when clicked
* Need to refresh page to clear screen
* Functions for formatting screen text are very hacky and wouldn't work if number is negative
